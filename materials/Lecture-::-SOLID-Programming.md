In this lecture, We'll discuss the SOLID principles, clear up any confusion you might have, and look at examples of SOLID in our course project.

#### Why should I attend?

* Not all of the SOLID principles are easy to grasp. It's normal to still have questions, and want to see more examples.
* The SOLID principles, when followed throughout a team, can lead to applications that are more sustainable and maintainable. Sustainable, and maintainable apps make it more likely that the organization will have: sanity, agility, good morale, ability to react to market-shifts, and much more.
