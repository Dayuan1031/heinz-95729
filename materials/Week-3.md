This week, we're moving on from programming basics to principles and experiences.

#### After completing this module, you should:

* Be able to describe each letter of the SOLID acronym
* Be able to design API endpoints so they are modeless
* Break a problem into concerns/functionality grouped by category and behavior
* Clearly communicate the responsibility of classes and methods through naming conventions
* Describe the Open-Closed Principle through example
* Indicate whether a given set of code satisfies the Open-Closed Principle
* Describe the Liskov Substitution Principle, and what it has in common with the Single Responsibility and Open/Closed principles
* Describe Interface Segregation and what it has in common with the Single Responsibility and Open/Closed principles
* Break a set of behaviors into multiple interfaces through segregating scope
* Describe Dependency Inversion
* Explain how Dependency Inversion can lead to loose coupling
* Describe Composition Root and where it should be implemented
* Explain the difference between dependency injection and service location
