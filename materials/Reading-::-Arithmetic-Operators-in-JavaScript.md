If you aren't familiar with writing [Arithmetic Operators in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators), MDN has a straight forward introduction for you. Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value.

#### After reading this, you should be able to:

* Add, subtract, multiple, and divide in JavaScript
* Find out if one number is divisible by another
* Increment and Decrement numbers
* Describe the difference between unary and binary plus and negation

#### Why should I read this?

* If you aren't already familiar with arithmetic operators in a modern programming language, this is fundamental
