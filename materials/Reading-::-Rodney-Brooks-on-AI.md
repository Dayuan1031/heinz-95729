[Rodney Brooks, emeritus professor of robotics at MIT, talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about the future of robots and artificial intelligence](http://www.econtalk.org/rodney-brooks-on-artificial-intelligence/). Brooks argues that we both under-appreciate and over-appreciate the impact of innovation. He applies this insight to the current state of driverless cars and other changes people are expecting to change our daily lives in radical ways. He also suggests that the challenges of developing truly intelligent robots and technologies will take much longer than people expect, giving human beings time to adapt to the effects.

Practical application of existing knowledge will not only lead to new discoveries, it presents great opportunity for capitalization, _now_.
