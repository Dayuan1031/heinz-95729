Often, when developing software, we develop to a specification that is the result of planning and design. I’m not going to get into this subject in depth. However, user stories will be used throughout this course, so we need to understand them before moving on.

User stories are one of many ways to communicate and document a specification. Consider the following template:

> As a [system/user/role], I [want/need] [to be able to do something], so that [something is accomplished].

Starting with a role, or the like, puts a face into the readers mind.  It introduces a character.  Writing the story in first person creates a connection between the reader and the requirement.  The reader is being asked for something, rather than being told to do something.  So before we’ve even declared what it is that needs to be done, the reader is pushed into a helper role, rather than being commanded or controlled.  This invokes empathy, which is an awesome conduit for understanding and creativity.

How do we deal with ambiguity, without getting into the _shall / must_ territory?  In first person, typically, we need something, or we want something.  Using these words, ambiguity is removed and priority is introduced.  _Want_ indicates an ideal scenario, but is submissive to greater needs.  _Need_ indicates that a requirement is an absolute must.  Both words should be used heavily within a given feature set, to help direct (triage) the reader to priorities. Sometimes, it's appropriate to use other verbs, such as _won't_, to limit scope, or to describe scenarios that might cause a user to reject a given feature.

Finally, the _why_ (“so that”) gives the reader insight into why a requirement is important, what function it solves, and also allows the introduction of other characters.  This influences design without designing.  It is a chance to clarify and remove ambiguity.  It allows the characters to say what they need, as well as what they don’t need, and what they need to avoid.

Assuming a good mix of wants and needs is presented, project organizers can can value wants, but focus priority on needs. They can gain a greater perspective (i.e. big picture), and comprehend a baseline that constitutes minimum viability. Ultimately, this can help drive a product to market more quickly.
