When we pass arguments to JavaScript functions, objects that we pass, as well as the functions arguments object can mutate, depending on what that function does with the arguments. This can lead to intermittent bugs that are hard to troubleshoot.

#### After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

* Use [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse), and [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) to stop mutation from occurring

#### Why should I do this?

* Argument mutation leads to unexpected experiences that are hard to troubleshoot
