Michael Feathers coined the acronym, **SOLID**, to help us remember the first five object-
oriented principles of class design, collected and published by Robert C. Martin1.

These principles offer flexibility and maintainability. Not only do they help us write code that is easier to understand, piece by piece, they also help us achieve a more holistic comprehension of our applications, and how they behave. Given the years that these principles have had to mature, we benefit from a wealth of tools, and patterns that ease our path to following them.

The [readings for SOLID](https://github.com/losandes/heinz-95729-materials-2017/blob/master/week-3/SOLID.pdf) are in presentation format. Note that many of the slides link out to additional readings and videos.
