In this lecture, I'll introduce design patterns for No-SQL data storage.

#### After this Lecture, you should be able to:

* Describe what RDBMS is
* Describe what No-SQL is
* Explain the impedance mismatch between RDBMS and OO Development
* Know that there are multiple forms of normalization
* Describe the n+1 (anti) pattern
* Name and describe several patterns for approaching No-SQL data storage and querying

#### Why should I attend?

* We'll use No-SQL data technologies in the course project
* No-SQL design patterns differ from relational design patterns. We will discuss some of these differences, and the importance of them.
