Well... it depends!

You’ll hear me say that a lot. It’s usually an accurate answer, whether the topic is opinion or fact. Like methods and classes, the answers to questions are almost always coupled with dependencies; with cause and effect.

The patterns and practices in this course can be used to write clean, solid software… or not. While a pattern _can_ be used to solve a problem, it doesn’t mean that it should be. Also, many patterns may achieve the same end goal, and we often find ourselves choosing between the lesser of two evils or better of two adequate competitors.

In any trade, success can be affected by the tools that we use to do the job.  In the software industry, we have a broad set of tools at our disposal, and many of them can be effective under the same or similar circumstances.

I will illustrate some cases where patterns should and should not be used.  In the wild, you will need to assess the benefits and risks of using a given tool, or in choosing one tool over another. Often times, the answer lies in the dependencies, so remember: when making these decisions, discover the, “on what”, in, “it depends”.
