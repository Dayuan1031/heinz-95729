In SOLID: Part 3 - Liskov Substitution & Interface Segregation Principles, the author provides a classic example that breaks Liskov's Substitution Principle. However, he doesn't provide an example solution. I've ported the example to JavaScript, using Objects.

What do we need to change, in order for this to meet Liskov's Substitution Principle?

#### After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate a failure to meet Liskov's Substitution Principle
* Refactor code, so that it meets Liskov's Substitution Principle
