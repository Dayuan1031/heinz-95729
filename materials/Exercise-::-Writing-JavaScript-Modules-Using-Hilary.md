Now that we know how to encapsulate our code in immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFEs), we are going to explore encapsulation through a third-party library, [HilaryJS](https://github.com/Acatar/hilaryjs).

#### After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate the module pattern **with** a third-party library

#### Why should I do this?

* The module pattern is key to supporting encapsulation in JavaScript, and it is heavily used throughout the industry. Many teams use third-party libraries to make it easier to load their encapsulated code.
* Our course project uses HilaryJS, extensively. It's time to start getting familiar with it.
