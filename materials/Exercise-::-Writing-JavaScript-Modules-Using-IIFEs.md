Now that we know how to write functions in JavaScript, we are going to explore multiple ways you can encapsulate the function you wrote in the previous exercise.

#### After completing this exercise, you should be able to:

* Demonstrate the module pattern **without** a third-party library
* Describe what an Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) is

#### Why should I do this?

* The module pattern is key to supporting encapsulation in JavaScript, and it is heavily used throughout the industry.
